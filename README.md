# MatrixMultiplication
This is a small project inspired by my studies in Computer Science. I am in my first Semester and was curious about how to make a calculator for matrix multiplication.
The project contains three important JavaScript-files: 

<ul>
<li>the file for outputting and change HTML dynamically (called HTML.js)
<li>the file for creating an JS-Object of each Matrix to calculate with (Object.js) and
<li>all the mathematical Operations like multiplication, addition and so on (math.js)
</ul>

I commented the code in German but if you like, check it out and comment on it. I would enjoy reading from you.

Cheers,

Lorenz
